 I'm Samsunnahar Bipasha. I'm doing my masters in Computer Science at the University of Texas Rio Grade Valley (UTRGV). 
 Being an International student in the United States, I'm glad that I have good expericences so far. 
 I have made some  good friends from different parts of the world and my professors are cooperative and friendly. 
 I love meeting new people from different places and backgrounds and interacting with them. I feel like this way I can learn about different cultures and values. 
 This is a short introduction about me. Hope, you guys enjoy it.
